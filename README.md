# Course and Student Management System

This is a simple command-line program that manages courses and students information. The program is developed in C++ and consists of the following features:

# Course Management
Struct Course with members ID, CourseName, teacher, fee, and creditHours.
PrintAll function to display the details of all the courses.
Struct CourseList with members courses (an array of 5 elements).
PrintAll function to display the details of all the courses in the entire array.
AddCourse function to add a new course to the array at any index.
Sort function to sort the entire array of courses in ascending or descending order of their ID's.
DeleteAll function to remove all courses from the array.

# Student Management
Struct Student with members ID, StdName, and RollNo.
PrintAll function to display the details of all the students.
Struct StudentList with members std (an array of 5 elements).
PrintAll function to display the details of all the students in the list.
AddStudent function to add a new student to the array on the basis of student ID.
DeleteStudent function to remove a student from the array on the basis of student ID.

# Program Flow

**The program is menu-driven and follows the below flow:**

The user is presented with a Main Menu when the program starts.
The Main Menu provides options to manage courses and students.
The user can choose to view, add, delete, or sort courses/students.
The program displays the relevant information based on the user's selection.

I will be actively updating these repos with my latest OOP using C++ assignments. Stay tuned for more!
